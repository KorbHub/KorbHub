- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KorbHub
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in application of machine learning and data science in chemical process, drug development, material science, healthcare, precision medicine, and its application in business and finance. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning chemical system engineering with interested in machine learning, data science, and complex systematic approach for process optimization and design. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me  superkorb2559@gmail.com (to discuss more about possibility of ds project especially application on chemistry
- I had experience as a part intern at Treasure data on NLP and Data science task, and past research intern in field of drug development and bioinformatics. Also, I have started to use my free time to do a data science and machine learning project for around 1 year. I just started my Github on June 2022, and plan to upload my past projects as soon as possible 
  I currently work as a data scientist intern at MI-6 (Material informatic startup company in Tokyo) as well as venture capital research assitant to gain business experience.
   My future dream is building a startup based on the combination of chemistry and AI.
