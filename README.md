- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KorbHub
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in application of machine learning and data science in chemical process, drug development, material science, healthcare, precision medicine, and its application in business and finance. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning chemical system engineering with interested in machine learning, data science, and complex systematic approach for process optimization and design. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me  superkorb2559@gmail.com (to discuss more about possibility of ds project especially application on chemistry
- Hello, my name is Korbboon Sathirakul. I am currently a first-year master student at the graduate school of engineering at the University of Tokyo. I am interested in the application of data science, mathematical modeling, and AI in chemistry, material science, drug discovery, and chemical engineering. I had experience in both research and internship at Startups, where I worked on a diverse range of projects, from molecular generation, knowledge graphs in material informatics, bioisostere prediction using deep learning, natural language processing (sentiment analysis, transformers, etc.), to robotic process automation.Â 
   My future dream is building a startup based on the combination of chemistry and AI.
